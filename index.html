	<h1>Paul Glaum, PhD</h1>
	<h2>Environmental/Ecological Modeler and Data Scientist</h2>
	<p>I use a blend of mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques to model and analyze complex ecological interactions at multiple scales. 
		My goal is to make this complexity accessible to all levels of scientific literacy in order to better facilitate understanding of the natural world and our place in it. 
		I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Davis in the <a href="https://desp.ucdavis.edu/">Environmental Science & Policy Department</a>.
		I earned my PhD & Master's from the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb">University of Michigan</a>.
