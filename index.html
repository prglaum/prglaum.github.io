	<h1>Paul Glaum, PhD</h1>
	<h2>Mathematical Modeler and Environmental Data Scientist</h2>
	<!--Commenting this out to try something else
	<p>I use a blend of mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques to model and analyze complex ecological interactions at multiple scales. 
		My goal is to make this complexity accessible to all levels of scientific literacy in order to better facilitate understanding of the natural world and our place in it. 
		You can see some of the techniques I use (Skills) as well as the study systems I apply them on (Research). 		
	<br>I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Davis in the <a href="https://desp.ucdavis.edu/">Environmental Science & Policy Department</a>.
		I earned my PhD & Master's from the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb">University of Michigan</a>.
	<br>In the meantime, please go <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul-Glaum">here</a> while I learn how to make a functional website. </p>
