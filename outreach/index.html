<h2>BioBltz at D-Town Farms </h2>
<p>A BioBlitz is an interactive educational event aimed at teaching ecology and biology through hands on experiences. I have served on the planning 
	committee and/or participated in running 5 BioBlitz events at <a href="https://www.d-townfarm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D-town Farms</a> in Detroit, MI. D-Town farm is a large active farm run by the 
	Detroit Black Community Food Security Network (<a href="https://www.dbcfsn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DBCFSN</a>). At our BioBlitz events, we engage students and community members in hands-on experiences 
	with wild life and museum samples while focusing on the ecology and ecosystem services available in their communities. 
	For more information, please see the explanatory video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ITXCHrL4Q0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>

<h2>Associate Documentary Producer </h2>

<p>I was lucky to conduct large parts of my thesis work in urban ecology with many urban farmers and gardners in Detroit, MI. I was then also lucky enough 
	to use that experience to help document their amazing work when I served as an associate producer for a documentary on urban ecology and agriculture. 
	The film is from independent Montana film makers <a href="http://www.highplainsfilms.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High Plains Films</a> 
	and is currently in the editing stage. Check back here for updates and eventual release information!

	<td><p style="text-align:left;">In the Peruvian Andres, the wild tomato (Fig 1 <i>Solanum peruvianum</i>), releases Jasmonates in response to herbivore attack. 
		<br>These volatile defense chemicals repell insect pollinators such as the buzz pollinating bees that these plants rely on (Fig 2). 
		Consequently this reduces individual plant fitness through what we call <i>herbivore-induced pollinator limitation</i>.</p>
