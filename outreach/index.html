<h2>BioBltz at D-Town Farms </h2>
<p>A BioBlitz is an interactive educational event aimed at teaching ecology and biology through hands on experiences. I have served on the planning 
	committee and/or participated in running 5 BioBlitz events at <a href="https://www.d-townfarm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D-town Farms</a> in Detroit, MI. D-Town farm is a large active farm run by the 
	Detroit Black Community Food Security Network (<a href="https://www.dbcfsn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DBCFSN</a>). At our BioBlitz events, we engage students and community members in hands-on experiences 
	with wild life and museum samples while focusing on the ecology and ecosystem services available in their communities. 
	For more information, please see the explanatory video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ITXCHrL4Q0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>
