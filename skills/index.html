	<h1>Analysis Techniques and Skill Sets </h1>
  	<p>An incomplete selection of the analysis and computing techniques I have used or tend to use lately. I've also included a few links to certain resources 
	  I have found helpful. If youâ€™re in need of analytical/modeling collaboration or work and any of these techniques seem useful to you, please feel free to contact me.
