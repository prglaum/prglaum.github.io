	<h1>Analysis Techniques and Skill Sets </h1>
  	<p>An incomplete selection of the analysis and computing techniques I have used or tend to use lately. I've also included a few links to certain resources 
	  I have found helpful. If you’re in need of analytical/modeling collaboration or work and any of these techniques seem useful to you, please feel free to contact me.

<h3>Computing</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Parallel Computing:</b> Local parallel computing via R, Matlab, Mathematica, etc. is a useful way to save time and make use of those multi-core laptops.</li>
	<li><b>Cloud/Cluster Computing:</b> Large simulations or analyses are best done in the cloud or through HPC clusters. </li>
		<ul>
			<li>scratch, slurm & pbs scripting </li>
		</ul>
	<li><b>Github/Git</b></li>
</ul>  

<h3>Modeling</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Model Development:</b> Ranging from creating models for specific systems to developing new extensions of existing frameworks.</li>
	<li><Model Types:</b> ODEs, PDEs, large food web and pollination dynamics on networks, IBMs or agent based models, spatial population genetics model.</li>
	<li><b>Computational & Numerical Analysis:</b> Linear stability analysis, bifurcation analysis, sensitivity analysis involving single and multiple attractors, 
		Lyapunov exponential analysis to study chaos, fractal dimensions (Kaplan–Yorke dimension), phase space analysis of multiple attractors, etc.</li>
	<li><bGraphical Analysis:</b> Volume of irregular shapes.<li>
</ul>

<h3>Network Analysis</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Analysis & Metrics:</b> Motif analysis & detection, network incoherence measurements, network assembly, cluster analysis, nestedness metrics, Jaccard index, connectance, 
		path lengths, and other standard metrics.</li>
	<li><b>Network Visualization:</b> creating visual depictions of networks for manuscript figures, to aid in analysis, and help convey research to general audiences.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>igraph & Matlab </li>
		</ul>
</ul>
