	<h1>Organismal Onogeny in Ecology </h1>
</div><!-- /.blurb -->

<p>The term “organismal ontogeny” generally refers to the study of the entirety of an organism's lifespan. My interest in organismal ontogeny stems from my interest 
  in how ontogeny interacts with broader ecology. In ecology, we often represent populations with a single equation in larger models of interacting populations. 
  Depending on the modeling question or species, this can be a sufficiently powerful modeling tool. However, it does not account for demographic heterogeneity amongst 
  subpopulations. This demographic heterogeneity can be especially important when different sub-populations have disparate ecological interactions that are ignored 
  when using single homogenizing equations. 
  For example, members of different age groups have unique interactions amongst their own species as well as between other species in trophic or mutualistic interactions. 
  These kinds of differences in ecology across ontogeny are frequently modeled as unique stages in the life history of organism. Hence these models are also often called 
  stage structured models.
