title: Dynamic Scalability
---
<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Dynamic Scalability </h1>
	<p>Many complicated networks can be studied as smaller components. This can give a detailed understanding of smaller systems with somewhere between 2 and usually 5 or so
  interacting variables. However, these small systems rarely exist on their own. They are frequently smaller subsystems of much larger systems. 
  This is true in economics, traffic, medicine, and this is certainly the case in ecology. 
  For example, a 3-trophic level food chain is relatively well understood in its behavior, but in nature a 3-trophic level food chain is connected to numerous other
  species through competition, consumption, parasitism, or mutualism. The question then becomes, how much are the dynamics of a 3-trophic level chain perserved in different 
  degrees of larger communities? Is there utility in studying smaller subsystems? </p>
