<p>The extent of human landuse has increased substantially over the last half century. This has seen the general expansion of both agriultural and urban landuse.  
	In fact, the extent of urban development is expected to increase XX by the year ???? (ref). This expansion necessarily comes at the expense of the extripated 
	habitat at these locations and necessarily changes the landscape for wildlife in the area. However, urban development in particular has been noted for offering
	potenial habitat and resource options for certain fauna, wild pollinating bees in particular. Given the sharp decline in wild bee species, there is interest in 
	determining how wild bees interface with urban development and what potential there is for conservation efforts. For pollinating bees with a need for floral resources, 
	urban farms and gardens (such as those found in cities like Detroit, MI see Fig 1) has been a focal point for questions regarding how bees can make use of urban spaces.
	My colleaues and I set out to address these questions with a multi-year study in southeastern MI. We set out to answer the following questions:
	<br> <b>1)</b> Can bees persist in urban agricultural spaces? 
	<br> <b>2)</b> What is the effect of the surrounding levels of urban development at these garden sites? 
	<br> <b>3)</b> What does this portend for future conservation efforts of these important pollinators?

<p>To answer these questions, my colleagues and I developed a set of sample sites consistentng of more than 40 farms, community gardens, and natural reserves. These
	samples sites created an urban development gradient goig from natural reserves with no surrounding development, to rural areas with limited urban development, 
	all the way to sites located in city centers with high levels of surrounding urban development. Please see Fig 2. At these sites, we sampled for bees and floal 
	resources using a variety of sampling techniques. To determine the degree of urban development surrounding each sample site, my colleagues used the National Land
	Cover Database and GIS mapping to quantify the buildup of "impervious surface" at each location. Impervious surfaces are categorized as hard, inpenetrable surfaces
	such as roads, buildings, parking lots, etc (Fig 2). In doing so, we created a quantitative map of urban development in southeastern MI and each sample site location (Fig 3).
