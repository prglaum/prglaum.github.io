<p>The extent of human landuse has increased substantially over the last half century. This has seen the general expansion of both agriultural and urban landuse.  
	In fact, the extent of urban development is expected to increase XX by the year ???? (ref). This expansion necessarily comes at the expense of the extripated 
	habitat at these locations and necessarily changes the landscape for wildlife in the area. However, urban development in particular has been noted for offering
	potenial habitat and resource options for certain fauna, <b>wild pollinating bees</b> in particular. Given the sharp decline in wild bee species, there is interest in 
	determining how wild bees interface with urban development and what potential there is for conservation efforts. For pollinating bees with a need for floral resources, 
	<b>urban farms and gardens</b> (such as those found in cities like Detroit, MI see Fig 1) has been a focal point for questions regarding how bees can make use of urban spaces.
	My colleaues and I set out to address these questions with a multi-year study in southeastern MI. We set out to answer the following questions:
	<br> <b>1)</b> Can bees persist in urban agricultural spaces? 
	<br> <b>2)</b> What is the effect of the surrounding levels of urban development at these garden sites? 
	<br> <b>3)</b> What does this portend for future conservation efforts of these important pollinators?

</figure40>
<p>To answer these questions, my colleagues and I developed a set of sample sites consistentng of more than 40 farms, community gardens, and natural reserves. These
	samples sites created an urban development gradient going from natural reserves with no surrounding development, to rural areas with limited urban development, 
	all the way to sites located in city centers with high levels of surrounding urban development. Please see Fig 2. With an overall team of 11 undergraduate researchers, we sampled for bees and floal 
	resources using a variety of sampling techniques. To determine the degree of urban development surrounding each sample site, my colleagues used the National Land
	Cover Database and GIS mapping to quantify the buildup of <b>"impervious surface"</b> at each location. Impervious surfaces are categorized as hard, inpenetrable surfaces
	such as roads, buildings, parking lots, etc (Fig 2). In doing so, we created a quantitative map of urban development in southeastern MI and each sample site location (Fig 3).

<p> Overall efforts resulted in over 5000 bees representing over 150 species. This gives us definitive evidence of the ability of urban agriculture to support 
	bee communities. However, our analysis found that bee community composition changed as a function of urban intensity (% impervious surface coverage). 
	In particular it was largely mediated by beesâ€™ nesting behavior. Wild bees species have two major nesting strategies, with some nesting in or on the ground 
	while others nest in small cavities such as twigs, trees, or even small openings in buildings. We can call these <b>ground nesting bees</b> and <b>cavity nesting bees</b>. 
	<br> We found that impervious surfaces (roads, buildings, etc.) presented obstacles to ground nesting bees. In particular, because female bees are tied 
	to their nest locations, this meant that urban development limited the presence of female ground nesting bees (Fig 4). Cavity nesting bees on the other 
	hand were found to be more abundant in urban environments (Fig 4). This disparity led to an overall trend to more male dominated bee communities in 
	urban environments (Fig 4).

	<figcaption>Fig 5: GIS map detailing the proportion of native, non-native ,and honey bee species at each sample site.</figcaption>
</figure40>
<p>As an important and related corollary, we noted that urban environments supported a higher proportion of exotic (non-native) bees than more rural and 
	urban environments (Fig 5). Given that the majority of exotic bees were found to be cavity nesting bees, this does fit with our findings seen in Fig 4. These 
	are important considerations in the effort to conserve at-risk native species and monitor possible invasives. 
	My colleauges and I hope that such knowledge about how different bee species are able to interface with different types of environments will be taken 
	into account in developing further conservation efforts to support threatened and endangered wild bees.
