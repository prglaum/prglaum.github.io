<p> Aquatic ecosystems are complex systems that connect species and populations through various ecological interactions. Therefore a single change 
   can reverberate out into the rest of the ecosystem. In the case of fisheries, researchers must take this into account to understand 
   1) the indirect effects of fishing/harvesting on the rest of food web and 2) how these changes can return to effect the harvested species further. 
   This is where networks come in as a useful modeling tool to capture the complex interconnectivity of aquatic food webs (Fig 1). We can represent
   interacting species as nodes and ecological connections (e.g., trophic interaction/feeding relationships) as network edges. Furthermore, by parameterizing
   our model with a powerful tool called the Allometric Trophic Network, we can produce biological informed metabolic parameters that give us flexiblity in 
	studying various unique aquatic fisheries and food webs.

<p> Our network framework also allows us to expand our consideration to the economic side of fisheries. We do this by making the extractive harvesting of fisheries a dynamic
	node in the network that dynamically responds to both available catch biomass and to fluctuating prices based on supply and demand in the market.
