<p> Aquatic ecosystems are complex systems that connect species and populations through various ecological interactions. Therefore a single change 
   can reverberate out into the rest of the ecosystem. In the case of fisheries, researchers must take this into account to understand 
   1) the indirect effects of fishing/harvesting on the rest of food web and 2) how these changes can return to effect the harvested species further. 
   This is where networks come in as a useful modeling tool to capture the complex interconnectivity of aquatic food webs (Fig 1). We can represent
   interacting species as nodes and ecological connections (e.g., trophic interaction/feeding relationships) as network edges.
