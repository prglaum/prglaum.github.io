<p>Pollination is the basis or major facilitator of plant reproduction for 87.5% of global flowering plant species (Ollerton et al 2011), making <b>plant-pollinator networks</b>
	critically important to both the basic maintenance of terrestrial biodiversity AND agricultural output. Plant-pollinator networks are an example of what are called
	bipartite networks gven the two classes of nodes (plants and pollinators; Fig 1). 
	<br>Unfortunately, the integrity of these networks are threatened due to widespread species and habitat loss. Consequently, any movement towards a sustainable 
	future must include a better understanding of how these networks function. 
	<br>My most recent work involves, organismal timing or <b>phenology</b> in the context of these networks. For example, organismal phenology for pollinators 
	describes what time of year they are active and foraging. For plants it involves when plants flower and produce floral rewards. 
	<br> An important driver of the topology of plant-pollinator networks is the diet breadth of the pollinators. By merging two benchmark theories of diet breadth 
	in ecology (MacArthur & Pianka, 1966) and (Waser et al., 1996), we developed and tested our hypothesis regarding how phenology can drive foragersâ€™ diet breadth. 
	This hypothesis is described below and visually depicted in Fig 2.
