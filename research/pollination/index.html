<p>Pollination is the basis or major facilitator of plant reproduction for 87.5% of global flowering plant species (Ollerton et al 2011), making pollination critically important to both the
	basic maintenance of terrestrial biodiversity AND agricultural output. 
	<br>Unfortunately, the integrity of these networks are threatened due to widespread species and habitat loss. Consequently, any movement towards a sustainable 
	future must include a better understanding of how these networks function. 
	<br>My most recent work involves, organismal timing or phenology. For example, organismal phenology for pollinators describes what time of year they are 
	active and foraging. For plants it involves when plants flower and produce floral rewards.
