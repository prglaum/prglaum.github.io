	<h1>Chemical Ecology </h1>
	<p>&emsp;Plant interactions with herbivorous insects are ubiquitous across terrestrial ecosystems. Consequently, these interactions play an important part in the functioning of both natural and managed food webs. 
	<br>Given the ubiquity of herbivorous insects, plant species have evolved numerous defense mechanisms to herbivore attack. Organic chemical defenses are a common defense tactic in plants to deter insect herbivores. 
	The production of chemical defenses are induced as secondary metabolites in response to damaged tissue. These chemicals can repel insects by reducing palatability or functioning as a toxin/poison.  
	<br>&emsp;Unfortunately for the plants, however, these negative effects on insects are not perfectly targeted towards specific insect species. In particular, broader effect and volatile nature of these defense chemicals 
	mean that they also deter important plant mutualists, such as insect pollinators. This means that these plant chemical defenses can reduce individual plant fitness by reducing chances to reproduce. 
	<br>&emsp;This leaves biologists with a question, how can this defense strategy survive if it reduces the individual fitness of plants which employ it?

	<td><p style="text-align:left;">In the Peruvian Andres, the wild tomato (Fig 1 <i>Solanum peruvianum</i>), releases Jasmonates in response to herbivore attack. 
		<br>These volatile defense chemicals repell insect pollinators such as the buzz pollinating bees that these plants rely on (Fig 2). 
		Consequently this reduces individual plant fitness through what we call <i>herbivore-induced pollinator limitation</i>.</p>
