	<h1>Chemical Ecology </h1>
	<p>&emsp;Plant interactions with herbivorous insects are ubiquitous across terrestrial ecosystems. Consequently, these interactions play an important part in the functioning of both natural and managed food webs. 
	<br>Given the ubiquity of herbivorous insects, plant species have evolved numerous defense mechanisms to herbivore attack. Organic chemical defenses are a common defense tactic in plants to deter insect herbivores. 
	The production of chemical defenses are induced as secondary metabolites in response to damaged tissue. These chemicals can repel insects by reducing palatability or functioning as a toxin/poison.  
	<br>&emsp;Unfortunately for the plants, however, these negative effects on insects are not perfectly targeted towards specific insect species. In particular, broader effect and volatile nature of these defense chemicals 
	mean that they also deter important plant mutualists, such as insect pollinators. This means that these plant chemical defenses can reduce individual plant fitness by reducing chances to reproduce. 
	<br>&emsp;This leaves biologists with a question, how can this defense strategy survive if it reduces the individual fitness of plants which employ it?

<p>Plant interactions with insect herbivores are important because they are fundamental to broader ecological dynamics and ecosystem functioning. 
	Plant-insect herbivore interactions are mediated by various plant defense systems. Plant <b>chemical defenses</b> are induced as secondary metabolites 
	in response herbivore damage. These chemicals can repel insects by reducing palatability or functioning as a toxin/poison. <b>Jasmonates</b> are a common 
	chemical defense in many species of plants.
	<br>
	<br>Interestingly, these chemicals defenses (including jasmonates) are volatile and can also repel pollinating insects. This <i>herbivore-induced pollinator limitation</i> 
	(HIPL) means that plant defenses can actually limit plant reproduction. So this can produce a tradeoff between not getting eaten and reproduction!
	<br>
	<br> This leaves biologists with the following long lingering questions: 
	<br> 1) How does this reduction in pollination scale with herbivore damage?
	<br> 2) How does a defense trait which lowers individual fitness sustain persist?
	<br> 3) What are the broader effects of these chemical defenses in ecological communities of plants, pollinators, and insect herbivores?

<p>In the Peruvian Andres, the wild tomato (Fig 1 <i>Solanum peruvianum</i>), releases Jasmonates as a defense against attacks from herbivorous insects. 
	<br>	
	<br>These volatile defense chemicals repell insect pollinators such as the buzz pollinating bees that these plants rely on (Fig 2). 
	These chemical defenses have been shown to reduce individual seed set in <i>S. peruvianum</i> due to HIPL. Using a unique dataset collected by
	my collaborators (see paper below), I was able to assertain the functional form of this reduction due to Jasmonate chemical defenses (Fig 3).

<p>Fitting a model of HIPL to the data shows that the reduction in pollinator visits (v) as a fuction of herbivory (h) followed what ecologists call a Type II functional
	response (Fig 3). I then built a mathematical model of interacting herbivores (H), pollinators (P), and flowering plants (F) and integrated the newly understood 
	Type II function representing the effects of chemical defenses on pollinator visits (HIPL).

</div>
<p>The mathematical model informed by our empirically defined HIPL function, produced a surprising and interesting result. The herbivore induced reduction in individual plant fitness rates 
	due to HIPL had the indirect effect of dynamically reducing herbivore population growth and density (Fig 4). This actually better supported community persistance and stability than if 
	the plants did not use their chemical defense and reduce their fitness via HIPL (Fig 4). Our results also imply that emergent ecological dynamics of individual fitness 
	reductions may be more complex than previously thought.
